# Half-Life: Alyx â€” FGD-fixes
Repo for fixing missing or broken FGD definitions.

FGD files are used by Hammer and contain descriptions of all the different entites in the game and what properties they have, etc.


With the offcial Steam Workshop tools comes the official FGD files.
However some have experienced broken maps and prefabs after the switch.
This repo is dedicated to storing fixes that can be solved using the FGD files.

I encourage anyone to help to submit suggested fixes here.
Primarily only additional properties and changes of variables types of existing properties are permitted.
Subjective changes like changing the default value of a property to something else will not be accepted.


## How to
Download all the files from this repo and place them in the **\<YOUR-STEAM-LIBRARY\>/steamapps/common/Half-Life Alyx/game/hlvr**
folder and make sure to overwrite any existing file.
